# Ansaetze

.. or Ansatzes as preferred by the english community.
Anyway, we got various of the most-used Ansaetze implemented in this package.

You can load them manually by
```python
from qml_essentials.ansaetze import Ansaetze
print(Ansaetze.get_available())
```

However, usually you just want reference to them (by name) when instantiating a model.
To get an overview of all the available Ansaetze, checkout the [references](https://cirkiters.github.io/qml-essentials/references/).
